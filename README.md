# 🐍 Snake Game (C++ – Turbo C++)

A simple, classic Snake Game built using **C++** and developed in the **Turbo C++** environment.  
This project demonstrates basic console-based game mechanics, keyboard handling, and simple graphics logic.


## 📌 About the Project
This Snake Game is a lightweight console application where the player controls a snake to eat food and grow in length. The game ends when the snake hits the wall or its own body.

I built this project as part of my learning journey in C++, focusing on:
- Handling loops and conditions
- Working with arrays
- Implementing movement logic
- Practicing interactive console applications



## 🎮 Features
- Snake grows longer after eating food
